## DEFINE PATH TO SAVED DATA
To generate a behavior dataset, run:
~/Dropbox/dynamic/check_rats/build_data_set_ephys.m

Saved model results are available at:
Dropbox/spikes/model/

## HOW TO RUN THE CODE
# BEHAVIOR/MODEL RESULTS  
    In the folder behavior_only
    I think most of this code is in a separate repo I need to deal with
  
# SEQUENCE PLOTS
    in the folder ephys_summary

# STA PLOTS 
# TUNING CURVES
